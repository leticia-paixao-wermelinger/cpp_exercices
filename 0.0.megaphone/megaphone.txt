Exercise: Megaphone

Objective:
Create a program that takes one or more command-line arguments,
converts each argument to uppercase, and prints them in a loud,
continuous format, as if amplifying them through a megaphone.
If no arguments are provided, the program should print a default message:
"* LOUD AND UNBEARABLE FEEDBACK NOISE *".

Expected Behavior:
$ ./megaphone Hello world
HELLO WORLD
$ ./megaphone
* LOUD AND UNBEARABLE FEEDBACK NOISE *
